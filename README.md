The Enhanced Traffic EXperimental Analytical Simulation (eTEXAS) Model for Intersection Traffic is a high quality, single intersection, microscopic traffic simulation model which has been updated by Harmonia to act as a simulation library for Connected Vehicle Program applications and to incorporate certain SAE J2735 vehicle messages. The underlying TEXAS Model, developed at The University of Texas at Austin, analyzes in sub-microscopic detail the behavior of driver-vehicle units as they go through an intersection and intermix with other traffic flows. The model contains detailed intersection geometry, path following, microscopic car following, lane changing, visibility restriction features, and surrogate measures of safety allowing it to be used for intersection collision analysis.

<a href="https://www.harmonia.com">Harmonia</a> enhanced eTEXAS and is funded for continued development. At this time <a href="https://www.harmonia.com">Harmonia</a> can take requests for further development and new features.

<strong>Want to give eTEXAS a try?</strong>

A running instance of eTEXAS is being hosted by <a href="https://www.harmonia.com">Harmonia</a>. Find out how to try it out by visiting their <a href="https://www.harmonia.com/products/etexas/">eTEXAS webpage</a>

<strong>Java developers can utilize the eTEXAS Model using the public eTEXAS Java API, which allows developers to initialize and run the microscopic traffic simulation one time increment (or DT) at a time.</strong>

eTEXAS is available for Windows X86 and Linux X86 systems. The user interface is written in Java and the model is written in FORTRAN.
