The Playback Parser is designed to help a user parse the playback data into a form which can be used by the eTEXAS webapp to play the data back as a simulation.

Requirements:
The playback parser relies upon Python and has been tested with Python 2.7.3. You may find Python on the official site: http://www.python.org/

Setup:
The playback parser is designed to minimize the amount of code you will need to write to parse your specific data into the playback data format used by eTEXAS.
Parsing your data will generally be done in the parser code. You can find a template for your parser code under parser_template.py. 
You can find an example code under peach_tree_parser.py. To execute your parser you will need to change all occurances of "peach_tree_parser"
in utility_functions_playback_parser.py to whatever you call your parser.

Executing:
For instructions on what flags you can use, execute playback_parser.py with no arguments.

====

The playback test generator is a small python package designed to generate integration tests and/or unit tests for eTEXAS. Here are the important parts:

1) I would strongly recommend copying this directory out of SVN before using any of its contents

2) Execute the generator by moving into the playback parser folder and executing playback_generator.py

3) To create a test, you should only need to edit gen_functions.py

4) The system takes care of creating the playback directory structures and generating detector events on its own

5) All the relevant data structures are located in playback_data_model.py

6) If you are interested, the write out process is in playback_write_out.py
